Hello judges!

Our website's name, Soteria, was inspired by the Greek goddess of safety and deliverance. The project was designed for individuals who
primarily travel on foot/bike to help them easily find restrooms and avoid areas where a lot of crime might be happening. We've also
included markers for unisex restrooms to help members of the LGBTQ community easily find restrooms that are gender neutral.

We hope you have as fun of a time looking at our project as we did creating it!

Thank you so much to HackTheLib for creating such a fun and awesome hackathon and have a wonderful day!!
