Hello judges!

Our website, Soteria, was inspired by the Greek goddess of safety and deliverance. We've created this project to help those
who identify as LGBTQ have an easier time finding gender neutral restrooms. The website was designed for individuals who
primarily travel on foot/bike to help them easily find restrooms and avoid areas where a lot of crime might be happening.

We hope you have as fun of a time looking at our project as we did creating it!

Have a wonderful day!!
